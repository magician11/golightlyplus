# Syzygy Solutions

![Syzygy Solutions](/img/syzygy-solutions.png)

Syzyzgy Solutions was born out of a need to more easily find images for websites I was building.

When building websites I wanted to use images that I could download for free, and used for both commerical and non-commercial purposes. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)'s [license](https://unsplash.com/license) is perfect for this.

I've always enjoyed using more natural forms of interactions, so verbally searching for a word like "fruit", then visually seeing options, and then modifying my search by simply saying "apricots" seemed most natural to me.

This UI was built with this UX flow in mind.
