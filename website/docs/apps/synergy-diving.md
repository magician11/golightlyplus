![Synergy Diving](/img/synergy-diving.png)

Synergy Diving is a platform to book diving experiences, and they actively support the freelance diving community.

Scuba and freediving instructors each get a profile on the Synergy Diving website. The instructors can then list experiences they want to run, and sell any related products.

Customers can then access the site and search by a location, and view the available experiences running in that location. Customer’s can then book an experience, and their credit card payment are automatically collected by the site, and added to the instructor’s account. Payouts get sent to instructors at the conclusion of their experience.

The site includes various automations like reminder emails to instructors and customers, resizing of images, and processing of payments.
