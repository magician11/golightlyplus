# Birthdays AI

![Birthdays AI](/img/birthdays-ai.jpg)

This is the story of how Birthdays AI was born.

Back in 2018 or so I decided to get off of Facebook. This was a huge relief, but also meant I no longer had any idea when my friendâ€™s birthdays were.

Being a developer, I decided this was actually a fantastic opportunity to develop a birthday app that did exactly what I wanted it to do.

Some of my initial thoughts were

- I only want to add and be notified of people I really care about.
- I would like a few reminders leading up to their birthday, so I can start thinking about what to get them maybe.
- It would be really useful to have both push notifications on my phone as well as email reminders.

So I built this for myself and found it really helpful. Then some friends started asking if they could use it too. So I expanded the app to allow accounts to be created. Some people wanted to download and install the app, so I developed it further to be accessible on both the App Store and Play Store.

It is easily one of the most useful apps Iâ€™ve built for myself and others.

It truly allows people to be reminded of peopleâ€™s birthdays they really care about. A lot of the motivation for the app was to foster human connection more ðŸ™‚

Speaking of which, I have a few close peopleâ€™s birthdays I just got reminded of, and going to send them my well wishes ðŸ™‚
