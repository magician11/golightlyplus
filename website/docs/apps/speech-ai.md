# Speech AI

![Speech AI](/img/speech-ai.png)

Speech AI was born out of a need to not stare at large emails, and instead have a lovely voice read it to me.

Using [Google Speech-To-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/), I found a voice that I could send text to and have the audio generated for me.

Sometimes I get emails or messages in other languages, so I added a module that the text could be optionally translated into English before it was sent to the text-to-speech API.
