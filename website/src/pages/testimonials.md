# Testimonials

> Andrew helped me go from idea to working app, he was proactive in researching the process we’d need to follow, breaking tasks down into next steps. Making great suggestions on best practice and how improve the app even further. I’d definitely recommend him and look forward to working with him again in future.

> Andrew helped my daughter and I redesign our existing blog site (www.motherdaughterfriend.com) to make it responsive to different size screens and add some new features (rotating photos, search capability, categories, etc.). We are really pleased with the outcome, and I found Andrew a pleasure to work with! He is knowledgeable, patient (I asked a lot of questions), and customer-focused. We communicated back and forth entirely by email and the process went very smoothly. I highly recommend Andrew for your web development needs!

> Thanks to Andrew we have an awesome bitcoin integrated iPad site. Living in Indonesia and having local staff i needed something easy to use that just made sense. Andrew was able to provide this service. He works fast, is professional and can work around obstacles that are thrown his way. He maintains patience as the design or data changes and is diligent to make a product that suits you perfectly. Thanks Andrew, i would recommend you to anyone needing an awesome tech guy. I think there is no job Andrew couldn’t tackle! Keep up the good work!

> I interviewed a lot of people before deciding to hire Andrew to develop my website, and I’m so glad I chose him. I was looking for someone who I would feel safe with emotionally (I knew creating my website would be a personal and vulnerable thing for me), as well as someone I could trust to create my vision. He came through in both areas. Andrew has a great combination of being someone who is really easy to communicate with as well as knowing a lot about technology. I was impressed with his quick response time in getting back to me with questions I had as well as his helpful suggestions throughout the process. I love how my website turned out and appreciated how much Andrew wanted this to be a positive experience for me and all his clients.

> I just love my new website! I found Andrew full of good ideas, clear in his communication, professional with the finished product. As a small business owner moving into the digital realm I have appreciated his input, ideas and affordability. Andrew was willing to spend time and was always quick to get back to me with queries – no question was too hard or menial. He had the skills and foresight to transform my ideas into an interactive and dynamic website. He has given me the confidence to forge ahead with my new on-line business.

> I have worked with Andrew fairly intensely on matters of website design and deployment, SEO, keyword analysis and network engineering. I have found Andrew to be wonderful to work with – pleasantly demeanoured, polite, eager to assist and willing to learn. I have observed that one of his greatest abilities is get stuck into something and learn it and not wait around for someone to “teach” him. He is a self-starter and a very capable one at that. I would recommend Andrew to any prospective employer, collaborator or business partner. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

> Andrew is a conscientious web developer and it is a pleasure working with him on the development of our two websites, www.awarenessinstitute.com.au and awarenessonline.com Andrew is always willing to go the extra mile and placate me on minor design requests with the most positive attitude so we can achieve the exact visual result we require. He is courteous, prompt in his delivery and will go the extra mile to deliver a fabulous end result, which has resulted in a happy client (us!) and a great deal of positive feedback from our own clients on our end product.

> I am a complete novice when it comes to building a website and I was so grateful when a girlfriend of mine recommended me to Andrew. I had been trying to find someone suitable to create a website that suited me and my needs for several months and just kept coming against walls so to speak… Andrew, created my site exactly the way that i wanted it created and he was incredibly patient too 🙂 … His service and work that he provides is fantastic and I highly recommend Andrew to anyone who is in need of a new and/or revamped website.
