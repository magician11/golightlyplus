title: How to build a website for free

I’ve been building websites for about 20 years now. Depending what you want from a website and your skill level with web development, will point to what web infrastructure you want.

<!--truncate-->

For every website you’ll need the site files (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images), and a domain name (e.g. https://andrewgolightly.com). If you don’t choose a plan that includes a custom domain name, you can always get one at [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
### No web development experience needed

If you have **no web development experience**, and want a fairly **simple website with a few pages** that looks really pretty and displays equally well on laptops and phones, and are happy to spend a recurring $20 USD a month, then I’d probably recommend [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/).

If you also want to **sell a few things online** (including in person Point of Sale), you could still use [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/pricing) and pay a recurring $30 USD or so a month.

If you start **selling a lot**, and start to have more advanced needs with inventory levels, variants on products (e.g. size, colour), discount codes, shipping, payment gateways, then you probably want to check out [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). They start at $30 USD / month.
### Some server knowledge

**If you know something about servers**, you could install your own version of WordPress somewhere like [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/d9c86410119c) on a pre-configured WordPress droplet, and pay about $5 USD / month.

Unlike Squarespace, **you’ll be responsible for managing updates to the server, and setting up security for it.**
### Some web development knowledge

**If you know how to code**, you can deploy a site to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting?hl=en) for [free on their Spark Plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing?hl=en).

You can use Firebase to host simple one page sites, all the way to sophisticated apps (probably then also using [Firestore Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?hl=en) and [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions?hl=en)).
### Concluding thoughts

If **you’re a small business**, and want a **simple static one page site up that rarely changes**, it might be worth paying a web developer to code that up for you and deploy it to Firebase. i.e. some initial investment, but no monthly costs, and no server maintenance required.

If you probably **want to make a bunch of regular changes to the site yourself** (assuming not much web development knowledge), you probably want to go with Squarespace.

Outside of these use cases, you probably want to hire a web developer to help you run and maintain more sophisticated websites or apps. If that’s the case, then [get in touch and we can discuss it](/contact).
