title: How to add a subdomain to an existing certificate using certbot

You’re probably reading this because you already have a [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate issued using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) for a domain, and now want to add-on subdomains.

<!--truncate-->

If you want to create a new certificate, have a look at the end of [this article](./nginx-wordpress-digitalocean).

In my case I already had a certificate which covered

- golightlyplus.com
- www.golightlyplus.com

I have a directory on my server called dev that I want to reference via dev.golightlyplus.com.

So to do that, I issued the following command

`certbot -d golightlyplus.com,dev.golightlyplus.com,www.golightlyplus.com --expand`

Key takeaways:

1. re-include every domain name you want on that certificate again. I forgot www. the first time. No biggie, just re-run with all the domains you want.
2. don’t forget to add --expand to the end

After reading around on the net a bit, I found this solution on [this GitHub thread](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/2230#issuecomment-268409183).
