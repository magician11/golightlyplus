title: How to safely store credentials in GitHub

It is actually pretty convenient to have credentials and keys stored in the same repository as your codebase. Of course this is unsafe, as anyone (if you‚Äôre using public repos) can use those credentials to access your infrastructure (databases, servers, 3rd party APIs).

So firstly if your code is not for public use, a private repository obviously improves the security of your credentials immediately.

<!--truncate-->

Bottom line, though, is if you store your credentials in a repository like on GitHub, encrypt those config files and keys first before committing them.

### GNU Privacy Guard

For encryption we‚Äôll be using [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/).

### Install GnuPG

First step is to go and download the binary for your OS [here](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html).

### Generate a keypair for yourself

Once installed, we need to generate a key pair for ourselves. Open a terminal and type

`gpg2 --gen-key`

Answer the prompts, and (importantly!) choose a strong passphrase.

### Encrypt a file

In your terminal, let‚Äôs say we want to encrypt a file called ‚Äúkeys.js‚Äù (which might have some config credentials that our codebase uses).

Type..

`gpg2 -e -a -s -r support@andrewgolightly.com keys.js`

What the parameters mean:

- -e means to encrypt the file
- -a means to ‚Äúcreate ascii armored output‚Äù. Basically you can view the file, instead of it being a binary file.
- -s means to sign the file
- -r means to choose which recipient should be able to decrypt the file. In our case I‚Äôm using my email address that I used to create the key pair above
- keys.js is the name of the file I want to encrypt

This will generate a file in the same directory called keys.js.asc.

If you view the file e.g. `less keys.js.asc` you‚Äôll see something like

### To decrypt a file

In your terminal, type

`gpg2 -d -o keys.js keys.js.asc`

What the parameters mean:

- -d means to decrypt the file
- -o specifies the name of the output file to save the decrypted data into. If you don‚Äôt specify this option, the decrypted contents will appear in your terminal

You‚Äôll be prompted for your passphrase for your private key.

### Update your .gitignore file

Now that we have encrypted our credentials file, make sure you ignore the credentials files, but not the encrypted files.

For example, if your credentials (config files and private keys) are in a config directory, you would update the `.gitignore` file to have something like

```txt title=".gitignore"
node_modules/
config/*.json
config/*.js
```

Now you can safely commit your encrypted credentials

`git add .`

`git commit -a -m "encrypted credentials"`

`git push`

### Backing up your private key

Make sure you backup your private key though. As if you lose it you won‚Äôt be able to decrypt those committed credentials.

To export your private key, type

`gpg2 --export-secret-key -a -o andrew-golightly.asc 'Andrew Golightly'`

Which will export your private key in ascii armored output to `andrew-golightly.asc`

To store it, there are a number of things you could do.

One way is to zip that file and encrypt it, and store it on a backup (encrypted) USB or external disk.

To zip and encrypt a file on a Mac, type:

`zip -e ag-gnupg.zip andrew-golightly.asc`

You‚Äôll be prompted for a password to encrypt the zip with.

Oh and make sure you remember your passphrase too üôÇ
